# Badges4All
In order for badges4all to work you will need to do the following :
- Install [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/)
- Install [Bdfdb](https://betterdiscord.app/Download?id=59)
- Import badges4all `@import url("https://cedrickzedd.github.io/Badges4All/badges4all.css")` or download as a [theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cedrickzedd/Badges4All/main/badges4all.theme.css)
- Join the [discord server](https://discord.gg/hGNtQ8rMQb) and request a custom badge.

### Note
I might implement support for powercord users


# Questions I might receive
## How much does this cost?
Nothing! I don't earn money for this. I just want to grow my own community.



## Who all sees my custom badge?
Only people with the import or the theme will be able to see your badge, which also means that you can see *other* people's badges too!



## How many custom badges can I have?
Only one per person. This is only because I'm lazy and don't want to add more.
